==============================================================

BEFORE YOU INSTALL
------------------
This application requires the Intel RealSense SDK to
communicate with the camera. You MUST install it before
or after installing this app, otherwise the camera will
not work.

--------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 - Install the Intel RealSense SDK 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to:
   https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases

2. Download the file named:
   Intel.RealSense.SDK-WIN10-<version>.exe

3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Restart your computer after the SDK is installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 - Install RealSense Lab Capture

1. Run this installer (RealSenseCapture_Setup_v1.0.0.exe).

2. Follow the on-screen steps.

3. Make sure "Create a desktop shortcut" is checked.

4. Click Install.

STEP 3 - First Launch
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Double-click the "RealSense Lab Capture" icon on your
   desktop, or find it in the Start Menu.

2. Log in with the default admin credentials:
      Username: admin

   Go to Admin Dashboard -> Users -> Change PW.

STEP 4 - Connecting the Camera
--------------------------------------------------------------
